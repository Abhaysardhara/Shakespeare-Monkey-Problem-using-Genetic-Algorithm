Naive approach take huge amount of time to find out target string from all possible combination. It can take years to find out target string from all possible combinations. We can achieve target string within minimum time using genetic algorithm.

Genetic algorithm perform genetic evolution from generation to generation and select the fittest members from the populations, which are most likely to transfer their genetic information to next generation.
Fitness function calculate the fitness of the each member and select parent with most fitness score. Selection of fitness function is most substantial and difficult task.

Crossover and Mutation brings variation in population. I have used one point crossover and applied 1% of Mutation rate.

Here is sample of above project.
